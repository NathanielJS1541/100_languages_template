# Problem 029: Distinct Powers

Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 5$ and $2 \le b \le 5$:

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms:
$$4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125.$$

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 100$ and $2 \le b \le 100$?
