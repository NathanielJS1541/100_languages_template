# Problem 026: Reciprocal Cycles

A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\cdots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $1/7$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of $d \lt 1000$ for which $1/d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
