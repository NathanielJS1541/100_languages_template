# Problem 074: Digit Factorial Chains

The number $145$ is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to $145$:
$$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.$$

Perhaps less well known is $169$, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to $169$; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,

Starting with $69$ produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?
